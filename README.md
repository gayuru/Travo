<p align="Center">Your companion that will not make you feel lost when you go to a new city</p>

## What is Travo? ##
ü§îTravo is your one stop travel companion when you visit a new place and feel lost just open our app and look for popular places nearby along with recommended places by user ratings. Travo utilizes Foursquare API to provide the user with a large collection of places near them alongside providing weather information using OpenWeather about the place they are going to visit.

## When to use it ##
üí°When visiting a new city, you will not feel lost as you can use the app to explore new locations in the city and view popular places near you. Or you can press the ‚ÄúFeeling lucky‚Äù button which will show a random location which is popular near you.

## Getting Started ##
Starting off with Travo is easy as it can get but surely you do need some credentials to access the foursquare api and don't worry about it as I will guide you through the process.
  1. Download or Clone the Travo repo from above.
  2. After you've downloaded it make sure you open the **Travo-App.xcworkspace** file as it's incooperated with pods.
  3. Since you are done with the initial process now we have to get a **clientID** & **clientSecret** from [FourSquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/places) inorder to get access to their api which is being used.
  4. Proceed to create an account with them and then create a new App associated with them in their dashboard which will be then used to generate the keys.
  5. Then you can navigate to Model > RestRequest.swift and find the line 23 & 24 where you have to replace the **clientID** & **clientSecret** with your own keys which you generated earlier.
  6. Whoooray üéâ üéâ now you're done with the setting up part ... Finally run the app on your simulator or your device of your choice and enjoy having **Travo** as your travel companion.
